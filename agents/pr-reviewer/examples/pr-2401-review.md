## Identified Risks
- Review SQL data destruction handling; the diff contains related paths or commands.
- Review destructive shell or git operations; the diff contains related paths or commands.

## Improvement Suggestions
- Document the exact CLI invocation and at least one expected output snippet.
- Add cases for quoted SQL, semicolon-separated SQL, and safe DELETE statements with WHERE clauses.
- Include one allowed and one denied shell example so reviewers can reproduce the boundary.

## Confidence
High - The diff is small enough for a reliable static review, assuming the fetched PR diff is complete.
